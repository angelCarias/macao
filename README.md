# Macao
A pretty basic lexer I made in Flex, a lexical analyzer for C. You give it an input and it will tell you if it is a float, integer, string, or something.

## Compilation
Go to this [link](https://github.com/angelCarias/macao/blob/master/src/README.md) for instructions

## How To Use
For most systems, you can type and use it.
`macao <optional-file>`

`<optional-file>`: If you want to pass in a file, you can. It will read from such.

## To Do

 - [ ] Recognize Whitespace and Special Characters
 - [ ] Make it more advanced
 - [ ] Recognize between negative and positive numbers
