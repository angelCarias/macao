## Instructions for Compilation
If you have Windows, you can download an already-compiled executable from the `builds` folder of this project.

If you have anything else, you must install a suitable C compiler like GCC.
After that, run this command in your terminal.
`gcc lex.yy.c`

This should work, if it doesn't, check if your compiler folder is set in `PATH`.
